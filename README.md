**"Must: Efficient, Secure Multi-Network Data Adapter - Optimizing data transfer between networks with variable bandwidth through compression, encryption, and intelligent data fragmentation."**

## Overview
**Must** is a highly efficient, encrypted multi-system adapter written in Rust. It's designed to optimize data transfer between networks with differing bandwidth capabilities. Acting as a smart intermediary, Must ensures the seamless and secure transmission of data, maximizing throughput in complex network environments.

## Features
- **Dynamic Data Filtering**: Intelligently identifies and processes packets meant for the target network.
- **Adaptive Compression**: Reduces data size for faster transmission, adjusting compression levels based on network capacity.
- **Robust Encryption**: Ensures data security during transit, safeguarding sensitive information.
- **Smart Fragmentation**: Splits larger data packets when necessary to fit the bandwidth constraints of the receiving network.
- **Bandwidth Optimization**: Dynamically adapts to network conditions to maximize data transfer efficiency.

## Use Case
Ideal for scenarios where two networks with different maximum bandwidths need to exchange data. Perfect for a high-speed LAN communicating with a slower WAN, or bridging data centers with varying network capabilities, Must ensures optimal data flow with utmost security.

## How It Works
1. **Data Reception**: Listens for incoming data from Network_1.
2. **Filtering**: Identifies and isolates packets destined for Network_2.
3. **Compression and Encryption**: Compresses and encrypts the filtered data to reduce size and enhance security.
4. **Fragmentation (If Needed)**: If Network_2's bandwidth is lower than the data size, Must fragments the data to ensure smooth transmission.
5. **Transmission**: Sends the processed data to Network_2, optimizing for the available bandwidth.
